# **'Brain games' project**
The 'Brain_games' project is a collection of five mathematical games developed using JS. In these games, users are presented with various math problems to solve, allowing them to develop their skills and improve their scores.

### Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/MariamManv/qa-auto-engineer-javascript-project-44.git

2. Ensure that Node.js is installed on your local machine.

3. Navigate to the root directory of the project:

cd qa-auto-engineer-javascript-project-44

4. Install the project dependencies by running the command:

npm install

5. Run the script of the game, that you want to play:

brain-even : this game gives you a bunch of numbers, you'll have to detirmine if they're even or not;

brain-calc : this game gives you a bunch of mathematical equasions that you'll have to solve;

brain-gcd : this game gives you two numbers, you'll have to find their grestest common devidor;

brain-progression : this game gives you a progression with one missing number, you'll hae ti guess that number;

brain-prime : this game gives you a bunch of numbers, you'll have to detirmine if they're prime or not;
